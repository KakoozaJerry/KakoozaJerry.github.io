I supported the development of a scheduler platform for the upgraded version of the ilabs service broker system. My contributions resulted in a system that could run on much secure and updated softwares such as windows 10, as opposed to the previous version of the ilabs service broker that had so many bugs.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Additionally, as an intern at Stanbic Bank Uganda, I utilized and grew my expertise in large scale system environment management . I supported their IT team in administering security softwares that were complying as per company regulations. My contributions resulted in an 80% full upgrade of banking IT computers from the old windows versions to the latest windows 10 version at the time.</p>
